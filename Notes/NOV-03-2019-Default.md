## Notes 

### Components that we might be using

components extra : 
- internal countdown timer
- buffer
- 
inputs : 
- pushbutton
  
output :
- LCD
- Buzzer
- 7-segment display 
  - run timer 

### Functions
- initialization()
  - setups the board
  - level -> 0
- challenge = produce_challenge( level )
  - depending on the level, produce the sequence of numbers that the user needs to memorize and input onto the keypad
- display_challenge ( challenge )
  - reads the sequence and displays the appropriate characters on the LCD screen 
  - after a brief delay, clears the LCD
    - maybe that should tie in with the difficulty of the challenge
- inputs = user_inputs()
  - start timer
  - user inputs their sequence
  - save the sequence input from user
- validate_inputs( inputs )
  - checks the user inputs with the sequence generated by us
    - if all equal
      - proceed to next level
    - else
      - exit_game()
- exit_game()
  - reset everything
    - board
    - challenges
    - sequences
    - levels
    - etc.
- shutdown()
  - shutdown the board 

### Things we should know what to do 
- display characters on LCD
- catch user inputs from the keypad
  - slide : IDE_HCS12 page 30
  - how to read the keypad and display number on 7-seg display
- save data into an array
- clear arrays
- read data from an array
- convert data to characters on LCD
- how to work with the timer of the board 

### Comments on the UML
- Wait for user block
  - what is the counter for ?
  - is this where the user should input their answer ?

- I dont know if the "Would you like to play a game" necessary 
  - is it for, if they lose, they can play again ?

- the start_game() function seems not needed since we have produce_challenge()

## Questions 


## Important 

- the keypad supposedly has some issues with under-voltage
- C does not have the notion of objects and classes 
  - so therefore, have to think of the return of the functions such as : challenge, level , etc.
